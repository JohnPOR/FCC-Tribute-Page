                    <h3>Banksy's Identity</h3>
                    <p class="bio-para">Banksy, a street artist whose identity remains unknown, is believed to have been born in
                        Bristol, England, around 1974. He rose to prominence for his provocative stenciled pieces in
                        the late 1990s. Banksy is the subject of a 2010 documentary, Exit Through the Gift Shop, which
                        examines the relationship between commercial and street art..</p>

                    <h3>Artwork</h3>
                    <p class="bio-para">Banksy began his career as a graffiti artist in the early 1990s, in Bristol's graffiti gang
                        DryBreadZ Crew. Although his early work was largely freehand, Banksy used stencils on occasion.
                        In the late '90s, he began using stencils predominantly. His work became more widely recognized
                        around Bristol and in London, as his signature style developed</p>

                    <h4>What Is Banksy Known for?</h4>
                    <p class="bio-para">Banksy's artwork is characterized by striking images, often combined with slogans. His work
                        often engages political themes, satirically critiquing war, capitalism, hypocrisy and greed.
                        Common subjects include rats, apes, policemen, members of the royal family, and children. In
                        addition to his two-dimensional work, Banksy is known for his installation artwork. One of the
                        most celebrated of these pieces, which featured a live elephant painted with a Victorian
                        wallpaper pattern, sparked controversy among animal rights activists.

                    <h4>West Bank</h4>
                    <p class="bio-para">Other pieces have drawn attention for their edgy themes or the boldness of their execution.
                        Banksy's work on the West Bank barrier, between Israel and Palestine, received significant
                        media attention in 2005. He is also known for his use of copyrighted material and subversion of
                        classic images. An example of this is Banksy's version of Monet's famous series of water lilies
                        paintings, adapted by Banksy to include drifting trash and debris.

                    <h4>'The Banksy Effect'</h4>
                    <p class="bio-para">Banksy's worldwide fame has transformed his artwork from acts of vandalism to sought-after high
                        art pieces. Journalist Max Foster has referred to the rising prices of graffiti as street art
                        as "the Banksy effect." Interest in Banksy escalated with the release of the 2010 documentary
                        Exit Through the Gift Shop. The film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, was
                        nominated for an Academy Award.
                        In October 2013, Banksy took to the streets of New York City. There he pledged to create a new
                        piece of art for each day of his residency. As he explained to the Village Voice, "The plan is
                        to live here, react to things, see the sights â€” and paint on them. Some of it will be pretty
                        elaborate, and some will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall." During that month, he also sold
                        some of his works on the street for $60 a piece, well below the market value for his art.</p>
